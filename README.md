# CSE 151A Group Project

## Abstract

## Introduction
Doordash is one of the most popular food delivery apps, allowing for a wide variety of choices on demand. Whether its a big catering event or whether its a really hungry individual, customers need accurate ETAs. Despite its popularity, DoorDash's ETA feature is sometimes unreliable. Motivated by this, in this project, our group decided to give ETA prediction a try.

## Figures
Figures 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 all present the data in a visual way, helping us understand the relationships between certain features.

### Figure 1.1:
Pairplot showing the relationship between individual features with each other. The diagonal represents the distribution for each feature. Each observation is color-coded by `store_primary_category` - the type of food or service the resturant provides (e.g. Italian, Chinese, Fast Food)

### Figure 1.2:
Pairplot after Data Preprocessing. Shows relationships between features and the distribution for each feature after removing outliers and normalization.

### Figure 1.3
Heatmap showing the correlation between each feature. Greater values imply greater correlation.
